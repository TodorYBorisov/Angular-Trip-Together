# Angular-Trip-Together
Trip Together represents the culmination of my Angular course at Software University.

It is an integrated project that incorporates a custom RESTful server using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose, Bcrypt and JsonWebtoken to handle server-side functionalities and backend operations.

The frontend is powered by Angular.

## Description
- Trip Together is a web application that allows users to experience shared trips with other users.
- The main objective of the app is to enable users to share a common vehicle to reach their final destination.
- Users have the opportunity to create passive income by making use of their cars.
- Using a Trip Together app can reduce carbon footprint, potentially save you money.
- Lastly, research shows that when users share common transportation, they tend to drive less, making them more environmentally friendly.



## Features

## Security
The project incorporates several security enhancements:

- Guards: Various features have guards in place to control access based on user authentication status.
- Custom 404 Page: An exclusive 404 page is implemented to handle undefined routes gracefully.
- JWT Blacklist: To enhance security, a blacklist system stores every used JSON Web Token (JWT) after a user logs out
