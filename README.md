# Angular-Trip-Together
Trip Together represents the culmination of my Angular course at Software University. It is an integrated project that incorporates a custom RESTful server developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose, Bcrypt, and JsonWebtoken to handle server-side functionalities and backend operations. The frontend is powered by Angular.

## Description

## Features

## Security
The project incorporates several security enhancements:

-Guards: Various features have guards in place to control access based on user authentication status.
-Custom 404 Page: An exclusive 404 page is implemented to handle undefined routes gracefully.
-JWT Blacklist: To enhance security, a blacklist system stores every used JSON Web Token (JWT) after a user logs out
